## Exercise 2 - Elixir version

Try an Elixir version of the OOP TodoList you just wrote.

Here's the API again:

---

`Todo`

`new(description)` Also sets `is_complete` to default of `false` => Returns a `Todo` base data structure (a map?)

`complete(todo)` returns new completed copy of todo

---

`TodoList`

`add(list, todo)` adds a todo to the todo list

`all(list)` return all underlying todos

`complete(list, todo)` updates the todo in the list as complete (**this will be the hard part**)

`to_s(list)` print all todos and their complete state in a nice way
