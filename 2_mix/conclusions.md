## What did we learn

- `mix` is awesome. It makes development much simpler.
- Don't forget to `mix deps.get`.
- If you want to test things out, open a REPL and get going!
- A mix project makes your project code available to you from any module.
- You can interact with external library code like it is normal project code.
