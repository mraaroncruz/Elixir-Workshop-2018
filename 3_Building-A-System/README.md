### Building a system

So far we've:

- Learned some of the difference between FP and OOP
- Built our first Elixir module
- Used mix to create a project
- Pulled in some of our dependencies
- Tried to break some things to see what happened

In this section, we'll build our first system.

We'll take the stuff we set up in the last section and combine it into multiple files that do something interesting.

Let's take a look back at something we learned passed over in the first section.
