### What we learned

- The pipe operator is really nice
- You can call around pretty easily to any module in your project from anywhere.
- Modules make it easy to encapsulate similar behavior where it belongs and helps clean up your codebase. You can expose functions that who's interface rarely changes while being able to change the implementation in your private functions.
- `Enum` is a Swiss Army Knife for lists.
