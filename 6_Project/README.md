## The Project - A web spider

You will build a web spider.

It will take a seed url and scrape the content and the links from the page and keep going deeper into the web until you stop it.

### Somewhere to start

`Links.Spider`

`start(seed_url)` - Starts spidering the WWW

`Links.Spider` should start in its own process (so it doesn't block when running)

Links are added to `Links.List` as they are found.

**Maybe helpful**

- the links should be held in the `Links.List` and be queriable
- It's ok to just run this from iex
